My experience testing the given Webapp was instructive. It provided me with a hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge into practical scenarios. I encountered various functionalities and potential edge cases, which helped me understand the complexities involved in real-world testing. I'm a student who favors a practical approach, and I feel that theoretical learning could benefit from a more hands-on approach. I thrive when I can apply what I learn in real-world scenarios, as it helps solidify my understanding and retention of the material.

2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I utilized a structured approach to write and manage test cases. Initially, I analyzed the requirements thoroughly to identify test scenarios.

3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.
I don't know testing very well, so I cannot recommend any other tools or styles.

4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I prefer Visual Studio Code for its versatility and extensive plugin ecosystem. It provides a seamless experience for editing various file types, including code files, markdown documents, and configuration files.

5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
Yes, I encountered challenges during testing, such as understanding the whole picture, because instructions were spread across multiple places. I learn faster when I can apply my skills rather than just reading. To solve the difficulty of scattered instructions, I took a proactive approach. First, I consolidated all available documentation and resources into one central location, such as a shared drive or a project management tool. Then, I created a structured outline or checklist to organize the tasks and ensure comprehensive coverage.

6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
I have used GitHub sometimes in my other classes, but I'm not yet a professional with it.

7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)
For test automation, I would consider using a programming language like Python or Java.
